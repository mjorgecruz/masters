# Master's Thesis: Development of an active trans-femoral prosthesis

At Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto and following five eventful years, the time came for me to decide on a bigger project to show and consolidate the knowledge obtained in the previous years as mechanical engineer student with the goal of obtain a Msc in Mechanical Engineer on Automation.

There were several suggestions prepared by the professors at the university for the students to choose from, but I decided to follow a different path and suggest my own project: I submitted a request and eventually my proposal to design a prosthetic knee was accepted.
